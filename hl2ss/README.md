## Build from source and deploy

Building the server application and the Unity plugin requires a Windows 10 machine. If you have previously installed the server application using the appxbundle it is recommended that you uninstall it first.

1. [Install the tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/install-the-tools).
2. Open the Visual Studio solution (sln file in the [hl2ss](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/tree/main/hl2ss) folder) in Visual Studio 2022.
3. Set build configuration to Release ARM64. Building for x86 and x64 (HoloLens emulator), and ARM is not supported.
4. Right click the hl2ss project and select Properties. Navigate to Configuration Properties -> Debugging and set Machine Name to your HoloLens IP address.
5. Build (Build -> Build Solution). If you get an error saying that hl2ss.winmd does not exist, copy the hl2ss.winmd file from [etc](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/tree/main/etc) into the hl2ss\ARM64\Release\hl2ss folder.
6. Run (Remote Machine). You may need to [pair your HoloLens](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-visual-studio?tabs=hl2#pairing-your-device) first. 

The server application will remain installed on the HoloLens even after power off. The Unity plugin is in the hl2ss\ARM64\Release\plugin folder.
If you wish to create the server appxbundle, right click the hl2ss project and select Publish -> Create App Packages.
